# Development changelog

This is the staged implementation log for the prompt-preset experiment. It is
kept separately from the product README so reviewers can follow intent,
decisions, verification, and known limits chronologically.

## 2026-08-14 — Stage 1: contract and package skeleton

Purpose: establish the installable package boundary and document compatibility
choices before implementation.

Changes:

- Defined one installable `dsh-tavern` root package with a Host entry, browser
  bundle entry, and dsh bundle patch.
- Reserved `packages/tavern-format` for host-independent ST parsing/compilation
  and `packages/preset` for dsh integration.
- Added a repository-level `data/` ignore rule. Runtime imports must never be
  committed, including the copyrighted acceptance fixture.
- Recorded the first-pass integration and compatibility contracts in
  `docs/REVIEW_GUIDE.md`.

Verification at this stage:

- Confirmed all three Git worktrees are independent and this branch is
  `feature/prompt-preset-gpt`.
- Read only the field/type shape of the acceptance fixture. No fixture content
  or file was written into this repository.
- Confirmed dsh `0.1.0-rc.6` exposes the right `details` slot,
  `systemPrompt.section()`, and the `agent/request` call-config waterfall.

## 2026-08-14 — Stage 2: format core, persistence, API, and Host seams

Purpose: make preset behavior testable independently of the browser before UI
work begins.

Changes:

- Added a pure ST Chat Completion preset parser with `100001` prompt-order
  selection, lossless raw-field retention, normalized editable prompts, and
  supported dsh call-config projection.
- Added deterministic-testable ST macro evaluation (`setvar/getvar`, user/char,
  random, dice, last-message placeholders) plus removal of unresolved braces
  that conflict with dsh prompt variables.
- Added a plugin-local atomic JSON store with traversal-safe ids, create,
  import, update, select, delete, reload, compiled prompt, and call-config
  views.
- Added a bounded same-origin JSON API under `/dsh-tavern/api`.
- Registered the selected prompt through `systemPrompt.section()` and supported
  sampling values through `agent/request`.
- Added synthetic unit/contract tests plus an in-place, structure-only test for
  the copyrighted acceptance file.
